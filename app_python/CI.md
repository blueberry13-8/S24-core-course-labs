# Continuous Integration Best Practices

- **Parallel Workflows:** Divide tasks into parallel jobs for efficient resource utilization and faster overall workflow runtime.

- **Dependency Caching:** Speed up workflow execution by caching Python dependencies and Docker image layers, minimizing the need for repeated installations and builds.

- **Latest Actions Usage:** Utilize the latest GitHub Actions versions to benefit from enhanced features and security updates.

- **Secure Secrets Handling:** Safely store sensitive information like SNYK_TOKEN, DOCKERHUB_USERNAME, and DOCKERHUB_TOKEN using GitHub Secrets.

- **Working Directory Specification:** Use the working-directory key to define the directory for executing subsequent steps.

- **Conditional Docker Image Push:** Push the Docker image only when the workflow is triggered by a tag.

- **Security Checks with Snyk:** Integrate Snyk for security checks as part of the workflow.

- **Code Linting:** Maintain code quality with a flake8 linting step in the workflow.

- **Efficient Docker Buildx:** Set up Docker with buildx support for optimized multi-platform image building.

- **Event-Driven Trigger:** Trigger the workflow on every push event for continuous integration.
